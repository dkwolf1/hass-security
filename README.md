# Hass Security

Hass Security is a Home Assistant add-on focused on security monitoring. It helps you keep an eye on your Home Assistant installation by aggregating security related events and presenting them through an easy to use dashboard.

This project began as a fork of [Scrutiny](https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny) but has since shifted its focus from disk health to monitoring Home Assistant itself.

## Installation

1. Open **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store** in Home Assistant.
2. Click **Repositories** and add `https://github.com/hass-security/hass-security`.
3. Locate **Hass Security** in the store and click **Install**.
4. Start the add-on and use the ingress link on the add-on page to access the dashboard.
